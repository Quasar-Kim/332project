# Week 2 Progress Report

- Week 2: 10/20~26

## Progress in this week

### Milestones

1. Project design finalization (~ week 4: 11/9)
2. Being able to sort small data on a local machine (~ week 6: 11/23)
3. Running the project on actual (~ week 8: 12/7)
4. (optional) Web UI

### Collaboration

**Role**

- Surgeon: Junseong

**Tools**

- Documenting: Notion
- Code: Git
- Communication: Discord channel

### Discussions on Design

1. Follow `MapReduce` paper to understand a fault-tolerance and a partition job.
2. Use `RPC` and `protobuf`, distributed sorting algorithms, and make a draft design.

**Algorithm**

1. (distributed) merge sort
    - Sorting subarray
    - Merging sorted subarrays
2. fault-tolerance
    - following `MapReduce` paper

### Generative AI guildline

- Using Generative AI is fine, but
- Just do not use Generative AI blindly.

## Goal of the next week

- Review on existing implementations and ideas
    - Read through `MapReduce` paper
    - Review terasort algorithm
- Get familiar with `RPC` and protobuf
- Create a high level explainer on how our system will work

## **Goal of the next week for each individual member**
- Junseong: work on prototype on local machine using python
- Jaehwan: get familiar with distributed algorithms, RPC and protobuf
- Dana: get familiar with RPC, protobuf, develop a better general understanding of distributed computin
