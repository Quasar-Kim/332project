# Week 3 Progress Report

- Week 3: 10/27~11/2

## Progress in this week

We designed simple, fault-tolerant job scheduling system, and implemented distributed sorting on top of it. We are writing a system design document based on the design. Current draft is available at `doc/design-doc-draft-2.pdf`.

## Goal of the next week

- Finalize design documentation.
- Start planning on code-level architecture.
    - Which networking library should we use?
    - How to structure each component of system?
    - How to test each component, without actually running the entire system?
- Prepare for progress presentation planned in week 5.

## Goal of the next week for each individual member

- Junseong:
    - Learn functional programming concepts related to IO (type classes, monads, etc.)
    - Review existing gRPC implementations and compare their tradeoffs based on various factors, especially on learning curve.
- Jaehwan:
    - Learn a network communication library of Scala (or Java)
    - Review the design document and try to experience  an implementation about the structure.
- Dana:
    - Get familiar with (or revise) functional programming concepts relevant to the design draft
    - Look into various approaches/implementations/libraries that could aid in the implementation and testing of the system
